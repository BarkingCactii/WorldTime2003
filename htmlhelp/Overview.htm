<h4>Brief Tour of WorldTime2003</h4>

<p><b>Main Display</b></p>

<p>The main display shows a list of display items with locations you set up to display. To 
edit a location or view its details, double click on
a location, or choose Edit display, select the location and press Properties..</p>

<p><b>Icons</b></p>

<p>There are a number of icons that can be displayed next to a location. 
Currently there are 3 icons associated with a location in the display: a 
person icon, an alarm icon and a daylight savings icon. If these icons are 
displayed, then that condition is enabled for that location. For example if the 
daylight savings icon is displayed, then that location is currently in daylight 
savings. If the alarm icon is displayed, then that location has at least 1 alarm 
associated with it.</p>

<p>Other icons ( depending on the skin ) will be for choosing a skin, adding 
locations to the display, alarm panel, locations database editing, help, 
displaying the next or previous page of locations, an options panel which 
contains all options ( good for compact skins ),&nbsp; minimizing the 
application or exiting the application.</p>

<p><b>System Tray</b></p>
<p>To remove the main display from the screen, but to leave the application
running, minimize the main application using the minimize button ( normally&nbsp; on the top right of
the display ). The application will still be accessible from the system tray.
Right click on the WorldTime2003 Icon to see options, or double click the icon 
to restore the display.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Minimizing WorldTime2003 to the system tray conserves system ram as well as 
processor time.</p>
