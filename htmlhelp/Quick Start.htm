<h4>Quick start</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    To get you familiar with the program in no time at all, please note the following:</li>
  <li><u><b>Ensure that your time zone is correctly set up</b></u>. This
          step is essential to WorldTime2003 running correctly. Do this by choosing Date/Time in the control panel
			   and check your time zone. <b>Most problems with this program have
          been from the incorrect time zone set</b> in the control panel.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>To add a location to the screen, press <b>Edit the Display </b> button.
    Press <b>Add</b> and select the desired location from the list of locations. To specify this member as 
  a person ( rather than a location ), make sure <i><font size="2">No personal 
  details for this location</font></i> is unchecked. Press OK, and the location or person should now appear on the 
  display. If you are using a skin that contains an options or preferences 
  button instead, choose that and pick <b>Display</b> from the options panel. If 
  a skin contains neither a display or an options button, right click the 
  WorldTime2003 icon in the system tray, and choose <b>Options Panel</b>.</li>
  <li> Note: There are 2 sets of lists. <u>One is the locations database.</u>.
          This is the database of all the location data and their time
          information. <u>The locations database list is NOT displayed</u>,
          This data is available for editing, but should seldom require it. <u>The
          other list is the display list. This is the list of locations that are
          displayed on the screen</u>. This derives its time information from 
  the locations database. The display list can contain personal
          information about the person at that location if you choose to display
          that information.</li>
</ol>


<p><i><b>Note</b></i>: Use the <i>default</i> skin when going through the quick 
start.</p>
