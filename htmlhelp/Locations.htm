<h4>Locations</h4>
<p>A location is a physical town or city. Each location needs details such
as its country, latitude and longitude, its offset from GMT, and its daylight
savings rules. These locations are not directly displayed. The Display list is responsible for displaying items on the 
desktop ( see Display List )
Display Items derive their
time and positional information from this locations database.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Editing locations is performed by choosing Edit Locations database from the 
main window, and choosing the appropriate action.</p>

<p><b>To Add a new location</b> </p>

<p>Choose <b>Edit Locations Database</b> from the main window and choose <b>Add</b>.</p>

<p><b>To edit a Location</b></p>
<p>Choose <b>Edit Locations database&nbsp;</b> from the main window, select the 
location to edit and choose <b>Properties</b>, or double click the location to edit it. If you have a display item 
which uses a location and you delete that location, then that item will 
automatically be removed from the display list as well.</p>

<p><b>To Delete a location</b></p>

<p>Choose <b>Edit Locations Database</b> from the main window, select the 
location to remove and choose <b>Remove</b>. Note: You should normally never 
delete a location from the locations database, but is included for freedom of
